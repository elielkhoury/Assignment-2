            At just 20, I blend education with development, bringing expertise
            in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, React, WordPress,
            Python, MySQL, C#, C++, and more. My academic path at the University
            of Saint Joseph, pursuing Computer Science from 2021 to 2024, has
            been foundational, notably highlighted by securing first place in a
            CCNA Cisco course. My professional journey began with a database
            management and web development internship at CCSS in Lebanon,
            transitioning into a role as a coding instructor at Brightchamps
            Academy in India, where I educated students in a plethora of
            programming tools.

            This experience paved the way for further professional development,
            including a significant position at Studio Yack in France as a
            Freelance Front-End Developer, focusing on responsive WordPress
            websites. Additionally, my role in e-commerce with Its Just A Case
            in the USA and ongoing private tutoring in Lebanon showcase my
            versatility and commitment to the field. My active participation in
            a Hackathon in Lebanon, where I developed machine learning AI
            solutions, alongside various freelancing projects ranging from Unity
            game development to WordPress website design, underscores my passion
            for technology and education.
